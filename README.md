## About

Hello, I am a 16-year-old frontend web developer primarily with an extensive knowledge on backend from North Carolina and I plan on pursuing a career in Computer Science, hence why I've dedicated most of my time into learning programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Lua, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.
