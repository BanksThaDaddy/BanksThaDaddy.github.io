## About

Hello, I am a 16-year-old frontend web developer primarily with an extensive knowledge on backend from North Carolina and I plan on pursuing a career in Computer Science, hence why I've dedicated most of my time into learning programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Lua, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I will be allowing anybody to purchase my services via my website soon. My services will include everything listed below.

## Services
**Website** - $10 (I'll make you a fully responsive and original website for 10 dollars bitcoin. For each extra page, it's only a dollar.)\
**Discord Bot** - $3 (Relatively cheap but I'll make a Discord bot that does whatever you need it to. For database related queries, I'll use quick.db as its simplest. Comes with a command handler and I send the full source code when finished so you can self host.)
